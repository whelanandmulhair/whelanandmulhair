<h1>Date & time</h1>
<p>Our party will be held in Glossop on 6th June 2026. There will be drop-in drinks at our house from 4pm-7pm and the party will be 7pm-late.</p>
  <p> So now I am interested in the AR and VR mountain of work, since there is still a long way to go, I want to jump in and see
    how big of a splash I can make.</p>

<h1>Location</h1>
<p>The reception will be held in Distant Hills Brewery. This is a 5 minute walk from our house. Will have a room booked in the upstairs section, so there will be stairs there.</p>
  <p> Parking is limited near our house .</p>

<h1>Dress code</h1>
